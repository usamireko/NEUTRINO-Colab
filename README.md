# NEUTRINO-Colab
Notebook for running NEUTRINO on Google Colab, opening the ability to run this SVS without downloading it to your PC, and also being much more easier to use it in low-end hardware or being in phones/tablets.

All the required files are stored in your Google Drive account, 7.6 GB aprox. is needed to download all the VBÂ´s and NEUTRINO itself.

Part of this notebook was based on the official one provided by NEUTRINO, but modified for user convenience. 


This repository has no affiliation with NEUTRINO and those involved in its development.
